# NgPalindrome

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.6.

## How to Run the App

```js
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

I left the tests and generated files in place.  The tests have not been expanded to cover the additional functionality.  Components have not been broken out.


### TODO

1. Expand tests to cover additional functioality added for palindrome finder (and errors/validation).
2. Break out components into their own modules.
3. Use inline styles or something smarter than off-the-shelf CSS.
